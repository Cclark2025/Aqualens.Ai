# AquaLens AI: Crystal Clear Water Intelligence

AquaLens AI is a project that uses computer vision to detect water pollution from images.  
The goal is to provide real-time, actionable insights that help protect rivers, lakes, and coastal waters.

We focus on:

- **AI-powered image analysis** to spot visual signs of pollution
- **Multi-source data** (satellites, drones, IoT cameras) for wide coverage
- **Clear, interpretable outputs** such as before/after comparisons and pollution maps

In this project, we build a **proof of concept** using **AlexNet** on a custom water-image dataset to classify scenes as *clean* or *polluted*.

## Who Could Use AquaLens AI?

- **Governments & municipalities** – monitoring waterways and compliance
- **NGOs & environmental groups** – tracking hotspots and building evidence
- **Industries** near water (shipping, energy, agriculture) – proactive monitoring

The long-term vision is to evolve this into a broader **environmental intelligence platform** that supports ESG reporting, risk evaluation, and global-scale monitoring.
